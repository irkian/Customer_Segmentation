# Customer_Segmentation
The project aims to identify different customer segments based on their spending habits using a credit card dataset. To achieve this, various unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN, were utilized. Before the analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into the dataset, and data cleaning techniques were used to ensure data quality by transforming skewed distributions into normal ones. Additionally, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was applied for dimensionality reduction to enhance efficiency. These steps collectively resulted in a comprehensive and streamlined approach, leading to a better understanding and interpretation of the data patterns.
